# adaptive-median-filter
This is a implementation of the **Noise reduction by variational method based on adaptive median filter**. Which can remove the noise points from the photos.

It is a course project of the **Computer Vision**. I implement it by using ***QT (GUI)*** and ***C++ (Algorithm)***.
